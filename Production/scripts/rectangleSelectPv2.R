Surveys are flown during the pupping season when animals are concentrated on the coast of Maine and timed to coincide with peak pupping estimated to be around the end of May. Surveys are flown from a NOAA Twin Otter at 230m within 2 hours of low tide using a hand-held Canon camera and fixed 300mm lens. Close to 1,000 ledges are surveyed and grouped into bay units for analysis. The data linked to this map is the estimated abundance of both pups and non-pups by bay unit each year from 1983-2018.
